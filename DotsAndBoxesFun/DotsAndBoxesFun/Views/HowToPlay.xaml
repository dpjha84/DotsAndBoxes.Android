After every 3 levels you have a major level where you can enter only with 5 or more stars. If you win all 3 previous levels but could not earn 5 stars, you need to replay some of those levels to make 5 or more stars. On reaching every major level your previous star count becomes zero and you need to win all stars all over again." />
